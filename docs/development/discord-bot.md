    The [core](./core.md) must be built before running the bot.

### Configuration File
The database and API can run out of the box without any configuration file using the [defaults](https://github.com/cathaypacific8747/am4/tree/master/src/am4/config.py). However, running the discord bot/building the frontend will require you to provide custom config.

To do this, rename `./config.example.json` to `./config.json` and modify it. Then, run:
```sh
python3 -m src.am4 cfg set config.json
```
This will verify and persist the settings to `./src/am4/.config.json`, which is used in future calls.

### Database
User authentication is handled by [pocketbase](https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase), a lightweight SQLite-based backend supporting OAuth2.0.

It is automatically started before the API/discord bot when using the CLI.

### Discord bot
It is similar to the API in design, but is more sophisticated in that it reads users' roles to determine their game mode.

To start it, use:
```sh
python3 -m src.am4 start bot
```

    ### Features
    Old bot:

    - calculates essential statistics
        - most distance-efficient stopovers
        - route demands, best seat configurations, best ticket prices, estimated income
        - player rank, mode, achievements, fleet
        - alliance rank, share value, contribution
        - aircraft characteristics and profit
        - airport characteristics
    - CSV export for route queries
    - fuel/CO2 notifications
    - aircraft characteristics comparisons
    - internal *Star Alliance* tools (now disbanded)
        - adding competitor alliances to watchlist
        - alliance comparisons over time: value,contribution/day, rate of changes
        - realtime alliance-member comparisons: SV/contribution distribution
        - member tracking: cheat detection tools, departure pattern identification
